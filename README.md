# Snowplow Elasticsearch Loader

## Introduction

The Snowplow Elasticsearch Loader consumes Snowplow enriched events or failed events from an
[Amazon Kinesis][kinesis] stream or [NSQ][nsq] topic, transforms them to JSON, and writes them to
[Elasticsearch][elasticsearch]. Events which cannot be transformed or which are rejected by
Elasticsearch are written to a separate Kinesis stream.

## Building

Assuming you already have [SBT 1.1.5][sbt] installed:

    $ git clone git://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-elasticsearch-loader.git
    $ sbt compile

## Usage

The Snowplow Elasticsearch Loader has the following command-line interface:

```
snowplow-elasticsearch-loader 0.10.1

Usage: snowplow-elasticsearch-loader [options]

  --config <filename>
```

## Running

Create your own config file:

    $ cp examples/config.hocon.sample my.conf

Update the configuration to fit your needs like modifying the AWS credentials:

```json
aws {
  access-key: "default"
  secret-key: "default"
}
```

Next, start the loader, making sure to specify your new config file:

    $ java -jar snowplow-elasticsearch-loader-http-0.10.1.jar --config my.conf
